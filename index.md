# The End of Software Engineering As We Know It

**A comprehensive exploration of how AI is fundamentally reshaping software development, organizational structures, and engineering careers.**

---

## What This Book Is About

For nearly fifty years, software engineering has operated under a consistent model: specialized teams, extensive coordination layers, careful review processes, and bureaucratic controls designed to manage the chaos of human-written code.

**AI changes everything.**

Not because AI writes perfect code (it doesn't), but because it collapses the fundamental assumptions that made bureaucracy seem necessary.

This book explores that transformation with rigorous analysis, historical context, and unflinching examination of what it means for everyone who builds software.
